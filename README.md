## How it works

This plugin will grab ProtonDB ratings from the ProtonDB API and overlay a tappable badge on the game page. Tapping the badge takes you to the ProtonDB page for the game.
This is an update on the protondb-decky plugin.

## Options

### Size
Choose between Regular, Small, and Minimalist (No text)

### Position
Place the badge around different corners of the game page header.

## Limitations

**Store Pages:** ProtonDB badges are currently **not supported on Steam store pages** due to Steam's security architecture. Store pages run in an isolated browsing context that cannot be accessed by Decky plugins. Badges work on **library game pages only**.

## Decky Loader

This plugin requires [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader).
